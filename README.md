# Spilnota Frontend Template
> **Note**
Uses `next`, `typescript`, `storybook` with `@mui/system`.
Don't use this template if you don't plan on creating your own design-system, or just install `@mui/material` or something else.

## How to use

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```

## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `@mui/system` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5. If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).
